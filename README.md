# Facial-Emotion-Recognition

## Introduction
Facial emotion recognition using CNN, Tensor flow, haar cascade, Numpy and cv2

## Requirements
* Numpy==1.15.4
* Ppencv-python==3.4.1
* Tensorflow==1.12.0
* Tflearn==0.3.2

## Usage
* If you want to train the model yourself you can get the orignal fer model from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013).
* If you want to use my pre-trained model you can get it from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Htb-GJ-o1NI__0zlJJhFnCmqBfjhWVGh).
* The pre-trained zip folder will contain 3 files which you need to extract to the main folder containing the uploaded files.
  * model_1_alim.tflearn.data-00000-of-00001
  * model_1_alim.tflearn.index
  * model_1_alim.tflearn.meta

## Results
## Any suggestion and improvements is highly appreciated.
